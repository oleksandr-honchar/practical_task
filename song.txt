[Verse 1]
Come touch me like I’m an ordinary man
Have a look in my eyes
Underneath my skin there is a violence
It's got a gun in its hand

[Bridge]
Ready to make
Ready to make, read'
Ready to make sense of anyone, anything
Anyone, anything
Anyone, anything
Anyone, anything
Anyone, anything

[Pre-Chorus]
Black holes living in the side of your face
Razor wire spinning around your
Around your
Around your
Around your (blistering sky)
Around your (blistering sky)
Around your (blistering sky)
Bullets are the beauty of the blistering sky
Bullets are the beauty and I don’t know why
Bullets are the beauty of the blistering sky
Bullets are the beauty and I don’t know why

[Chorus]
Personal responsibility (Insanity)
Personal responsibility (Insanity)
Personal responsibility (Insanity)

[Verse 2]
Confine me let me be the lesser of a beautiful man
Without the blood on his hands
Come and make me a martyr come and break my feeling
With your violence with the gun on my head

[Bridge]
Ready to take
Ready to take
Ready to take
Ready to take out anyone, anywhere
Anyone, anywhere
Anyone, anywhere
Anyone, anywhere
Anyone, anywhere

[Pre-Chorus]
Black holes living in the side of your face
Razor wire spinning around your
Around your
Around your
Around your (blistering sky)
Around your (blistering sky)
Around your (blistering sky)
Bullets are the beauty of the blistering sky
Bullets are the beauty and I don’t know why
Bullets are the beauty of the blistering sky
Bullets are the beauty and I don’t know why
